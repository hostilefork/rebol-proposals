    Title: {JOIN Dialect (codename: COMBINE)}

    Description: {
        The COMBINE dialect is intended to assist with the common task of
        creating a merged string series out of component Rebol values.  Its
        goal is to be friendlier than REJOIN...and to be the engine that
        powers the PRINT primitive.

        Currently in a proposal period, and there are questions about whether
        the same dialect can be meaningful for blocks or not.

           http://blog.hostilefork.com/combine-alternative-rebol-red-rejoin/ 

        While the name COMBINE is not bad, it has several things making it
        less desirable than JOIN.  Though JOIN was the original requested
        name, it was backed off after significant resistance defending
        its existing definition:

            join: func [
                "Concatenates values."
                value "Base value"
                rest "Value or block of values"
            ] [
                value: either series? :value [copy value] [form :value]
                repend value :rest
            ]

        Yet the usefulness of COMBINE has come to be so overwhelming that the
        Ren Garden project is going ahead with giving the name JOIN to it,
        in the defaults.  But the proposal is keeping the name COMBINE for
        usage in Rebol if it refuses to accept the change.  Thus, for the
        purposes of co-evolution it will continue to be called COMBINE in
        conversation.

        ; Major point of review for using a /PART-style refinement on
        ; a DO-like evaluator...what if your /PART location does not
        ; land on an evaluation boundary?  How would you stop at half
        ; an addition, e.g.:
        ;
        ;     do/part [1 + 2 3 + 4] 2
        ;
        ; A little sad to rule it out when many scenarios do have enough
        ; control to make use of what they need.  Restricting /PART to
        ; mechanical cases where they "can't fail" only causes people
        ; to use a COPY/PART and then a DO (or COMPOSE) on the extracted
        ; portion...often getting errors anyway.
        ;
        ; (One unusual case where a COPY/PART can avoid errors that a
        ; COMPOSE/PART wouldn't is when they remove things off the boundary
        ; that are infix operators...which can extend an evaluation
        ; when having it missing would terminate it cleanly.  This is more
        ; one of the many cases where permitting infix screws something
        ; up vs. an indictment of COMPOSE/PART.)
        ;
        ; In any case, as the first case of setting precedent for an
        ; evaluative /PART, the test behavior will be to see if you
        ; passed a point or nailed it.  TBD...

            ; something more MOLD-like has a consequence, e.g.:
            ;
            ;     print [quote Hello: %{/filename with/spaces/in it}]
            ;
            ; Gives you:
            ;
            ;     Hello: /filename with/spaces/in it
            ;
            ; Which is clearly not LOADable, and puts responsibility of
            ; delimiting things which may contain spaces upon the user.
            ; You may MOLD to avoid this, of course:
            ;
            ;     print [quote Hello: mold %{/filename with/spaces in it}]
            ;
            ; Then you will get:
            ;
            ;     Hello: %{/filename with/spaces in it}
            ;
            ; However, the default is to use TO-STRING and not raise an error,
            ; by popular request.
