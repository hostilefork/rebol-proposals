    Title: {FIND-MIN and FIND-MAX}

    Description: {
    	MIN and MAX exist as arity 2 for getting back the larger of two values.
    	MINIMUM-OF and MAXIMUM-OF, exist as arity 1 for looking for the largest
    	item in a series, but somewhat confusingly return series positions.
    	This uses proposed replacement names FIND-MIN and FIND-MAX
    }
